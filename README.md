# Web application for Final Year Project in NTU titled: Mobile phone-based 3D digitization (SCE17-0776)
This is the implementation of the web application for Virtuaso.
<br>

<br><br>
Virtuaso consists of a web application that integrates and enhances Tan Jiasheng's 3D reconstruction pipeline prototype to provide an end-to-end and self-contained 3D reconstruction system using photogrammetry.
<br><br>
Various improvements include:
- Stage-by-stage reconstruction
- Definable quality when generating models via mesh simplification
- Better noise reduction via mesh splitting using Trimesh
- Better feature-matching processing via conducting of 
- Multi-file and multi-format exporting of generated models
<br><br>
## Main features:
- End-to-end 3D reconstruction of 3D mesh models via photogrammetry
- Fully self-contained, requiring no other tools for 3D reconstruction nor for exporting of generated 3D mesh models
- Able to conduct pipeline processes in stages for .ply files not generated by Virtuaso
- Viewing and editing of generated 3D models
- Free exporting of 3D models into .ply / .stl / .obj files in either binary or ASCII format

### Credits
Virtuaso's web application integrates the following open-sourced tools and software: 
- Tan Jiasheng 3D reconstruction pipeline prototype (https://bitbucket.org/teejs/3d-recon.git)
- Trimesh (https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh)
