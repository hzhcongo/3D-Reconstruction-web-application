# 3D-Reconstruction-iOS-application (Virtuaso)
Virtuaso has a web application that integrates an end-to-end and self-contained 3D Reconstruction pipeline.
<br>
It allows users to reconstruct 3D models of objects using stereo photogrammetry processes, based on multiple images taken of the object. <br><br>
NOTE: This project has been an ongoing one, with the prototype being started off from Tan Jiasheng's Masters thesis.

## Main features:
- End-to-end 3D reconstruction of models using multiple images of a real-life object
- Fully-contained, requiring no other software or tools during 3D reconstruction
- Able to apply pipeline processes onto .ply files not generated by Virtuaso
- Viewing and editing of generated 3D models
- Exporting of 3D models into .ply / .stl / .obj files in either binary or ASCII format


## Credits
Virtuaso integrates the following open-sourced tools and software: 
- osmbundler (https://github.com/HaiyangXu/osm-bundler)
